step 1:Setting a bit means that if c-th bit is 0, then set it to 1 and if it is 1 then leave it unchanged.
step 2:Clearing a bit means that if c-th bit is 1, then clear it to 0 and if it is 0 then leave it unchanged.
step 3:Toggling a bit means that if c-th bit is 1, then change it to 0 and if it is 0 then change it to 1.
step 4:Testing a bit of a number is important in circuits when you need to read a value from a variable.
step5:Extract bits by applying an AND mask, with every bit set to 0, except those you want to extract, which you will set to 1. .
step 6:monitoring a bit means we need to read status of flag bit in hardware register. These flag bit controls or indicate hardware feature
